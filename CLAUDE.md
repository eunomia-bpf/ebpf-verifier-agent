## Project Overview

**BPFix** — Proof Trace Analysis for eBPF Verifier Failures.

Research project that analyzes eBPF verifier verbose logs (complete abstract interpreter execution traces) to automatically extract critical state transitions, causal chains, and structured diagnostics. Pure userspace — no kernel patches needed. Target: systems publication.

### Core Thesis

The eBPF verifier at LOG_LEVEL2 already outputs rich per-instruction abstract state (register types, scalar bounds, pointer offsets, BTF source lines, backtracking info). When a program is rejected, this trace contains all the information needed to understand the failure — but it's buried in 500-1000+ lines of flat text. BPFix parses the complete proof trace to extract where the proof was lost, why, and how to fix it.

## Using Codex CLI as Subagent

OpenAI Codex CLI is available on this machine (`codex-cli 0.113.0`, default model: `gpt-5.4`).

### Division of Labor (IMPORTANT)
- **Codex handles**: ALL code implementation, data collection, data analysis, experiment scripts, literature search/summarization, prototype building, test writing
- **Claude Code handles**: scheduling/dispatching codex tasks, document writing (non-tmp), CLAUDE.md/memory updates, architectural decisions, reviewing codex output, paper framing
- **Claude Code must NEVER**: write analysis code directly, run experiments directly, or manually collect data — always delegate to codex

### Workflow Rules
- **Codex output goes to `docs/tmp/`** — codex writes analysis/research/design docs into `docs/tmp/`
- **Claude maintains non-tmp docs** — Claude directly edits `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/research-plan.md`, and other non-tmp documents
- **Codex runs in background** — use `run_in_background: true` for all codex tasks; Claude dispatches and moves on
- **Review cycle** — when codex produces a new document, dispatch another codex to review it; iterate until quality is sufficient
- **Never ask for confirmation** — just keep going, do all work, iterate multiple rounds autonomously
- **Single agent for build+code+test** — Do NOT split building, code modification, and testing/running into separate subagents. Use ONE agent that can iterate: write code → run tests → see failure → fix → rerun. Only split when tasks are truly independent (e.g., two unrelated eval scripts). This avoids the problem where a test agent finds bugs but can't fix them.

### Usage
```bash
# Non-interactive execution — no sandbox, no prompts
codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox "your prompt here"

# With a specific working directory
codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox -C /path/to/dir "your prompt here"
```

## Research Phases

### Phase 1: Case Collection ✅
- Unified under `bpfix-bench/`
- 186 replayable verifier-reject cases currently admitted: 85 kernel selftests, 83 Stack Overflow, 18 GitHub issues
- 736 external SO/GH/commit raw records archived for reproduced/unreproduced audit, plus kernel-selftest raw fixtures
- 5-class taxonomy with stable error IDs

### Phase 2: Proof Trace Analysis (CURRENT)
- Parse verifier verbose logs (per-instruction register state traces)
- Detect critical state transitions (bounds collapse, type downgrade, provenance loss)
- Extract causal chains from error point back to root cause instruction
- Map to source code via BTF line_info annotations

### Phase 3: Evaluation Dataset
- Build (buggy_code, verifier_log, fixed_code) triples from Rex commits, SO answers, ebpf-verifier-errors
- Evaluate: structured trace analysis vs raw log for LLM agent repair

## Key Design Decisions
- **Pure userspace** — verifier LOG_LEVEL2 already has complete abstract state; no kernel patch needed
- **Analyze full state trace, not just error message** — key difference from Pretty Verifier (regex on error line only)
- **Agent is application, not contribution** — the paper's contribution is trace analysis
- **Passing verifier ≠ semantic correctness** — always include task-level semantic oracle
