# External Raw Corpus

This directory stores every collected external SO/GH candidate, including cases
that do not yet replay locally. Replayable verifier rejects are still admitted
only under `bpfix-bench/cases/`.

Layout:

- `so/stackoverflow-<question_id>.yaml`: Stack Overflow questions.
- `gh/github-<owner>-<repo>-<issue>.yaml`: GitHub issues.
- `gh/github-commit-<repo>-<commit>.yaml`: GitHub commit-derived candidates.
- `kernel_selftests/*.yaml`: kernel selftest verifier-log fixtures retained from the same unified bench root.
- `index.yaml`: generated summary linking raw records to replayable cases.

Each raw record uses `schema_version: bpfix.raw_external/v1`:

```yaml
raw_id: stackoverflow-70750259
source_kind: stackoverflow        # stackoverflow | github_issue | github_commit
source:
  url: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70750259
  title: ...
collector:
  original_path: bpfix-bench/raw/so/stackoverflow-70750259.yaml
content:
  has_verifier_log: true
  source_snippet_count: 2
reproduction:
  status: replay_valid
  case_path: cases/stackoverflow-70750259
  artifact_path: null
raw:
  ...
```

`reproduction.status` values:

- `replay_valid`: admitted to `bpfix-bench/cases/`.
- `replay_valid_pending_import`: locally rebuilds and rejects with a trace-rich
  verifier log, but is not yet in `cases/`.
- `replay_reject_no_rejected_insn`: locally rejects before any instruction is
  processed; useful raw evidence, but excluded from strict case admission.
- `attempted_accepted`: reconstructed artifact builds and loads successfully on
  the pinned environment.
- `attempted_failed` / `attempted_unknown`: reconstruction was tried but did not
  produce a strict replayable verifier-reject case.
- `candidate_for_replay`: raw record has verifier-reject evidence and enough
  source/context to plausibly build the next replay harness.
- `needs_manual_reconstruction`: raw record is useful, but requires manual
  extraction or synthesis of a standalone `make` + `bpftool` reproducer.
- `missing_verifier_log`: source/context exists, but no concrete verifier log is
  available.
- `missing_source`: verifier-like evidence exists, but source or harness context
  is missing.
- `environment_required`: reproducing depends on a larger framework, cluster,
  kernel feature, architecture, or toolchain environment not captured locally.
- `out_of_scope_non_verifier`: collected record is not a verifier-reject
  benchmark candidate.

Policy:

- Raw inclusion means only “collected external evidence”, not benchmark
  admission.
- `cases/` inclusion requires fresh local replay that builds and is rejected by
  the pinned verifier/toolchain.
- `raw/index.yaml` is the audit surface for counting collected, reproduced, and
  unreproduced external material.
